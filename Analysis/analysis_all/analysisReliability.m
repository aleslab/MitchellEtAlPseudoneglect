%% Bias study group-level analyis
%% AG.Mitchell - 24.11.18
% This script takes the data from the MLB, LM and TRB tasks for each
% participant
% Data gets collated in a manner that's translatable to most statistical
% platforms
% Takes proportion error from MLB and TRB, and the threshold to 50%
% (stimulus asymmetry when the participant thinks the line is bisected down
% the midline) for LM tasks and uses Cronbach's alpha to assess whether the
% data is consistent across sessions and modalities
